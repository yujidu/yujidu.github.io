Welcome to my homepage! 

I am Jidu Yu (于际都 in Chinese) and I was born and raised in [XuZhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou), a famous historical and cultural city in China. 

I obtained my B.Eng and M.Eng in Hydraulic Engineering from Hohai University (HHU) in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Now, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Geotechnical Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof Zhao Jidong](http://jzhao.people.ust.hk/).

My current research interest focuses on:
* Multi-scale and multi-physics approaches for modeling granular material 
* Mesh-less approaches, i.e., integration scheme, contact algorithm, stabilization
* High-performance computing for numerical approaches
* Hybrid approach, i.e., MPM-FEM coupling
