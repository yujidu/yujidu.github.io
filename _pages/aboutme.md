Welcome to my homepage! 

I am Jidu Yu (Chinese: 于际都) and I was born and raised in [XuZhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xuzhou), a famous historical and cultural city in China. 

I obtained my B.Eng and M.Eng in Hydraulic Engineering from Hohai University (HHU) in 2018 and 2021, respectively. Now, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Geotechnical Engineering at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), supervised by [Prof Zhao Jidong](http://jzhao.people.ust.hk/).

My current research interest focuses on:
* Particle or mesh-free methods, and hybrid methods, i.e., MPM, DEM, MPM-DEM, MPM-FVM
* Multiphysics modelling of mutiphase granular soils, particularly for permafrost and hydrate-bearing soils 
* Climate effect on soil behaviours, i.e., rainfall-induced landslides, permafrost thaw-related problems
* Soil behaviours in extreme environments, i.e., submarine, deep underground,and outer space
* Deep learning-aided multiscale and multiphysics modelling in geomechanics
