## 1. Thermo-hydro-mechanical coupled MPM for saturated porous media

Jidu works on develop stablized and efficient MPM algrithms for modelling the thermo-hydro-mechanical ï¼ˆTHM reponses in porous media.

* Four-variable *u-v-p-T* formualtion for non-isothermal saturated porous media.
* A semi-implicit solution scheme based on fractional step method;
* Both the incompressible and weakly compressible fluid are considered.
